In a devcontainer setup, the Gemini Companion extension sets a dynamic GEMINI_CLI_IDE_SERVER_PORT environment variable each time the container starts. However, this port is not automatically forwarded, so gemini-cli inside the container cannot connect to the IDE server unless the correct port is manually forwarded.

âœ… Temporary Workaround
Ensure the Gemini CLI Companion extension is installed and running inside the devcontainer

Open Command Palette â†’ Developer: Show Running Extensions
Confirm that google.gemini-cli-vscode-ide-companion is listed and active
Open a terminal inside the devcontainer

Run:

```
echo $GEMINI_CLI_IDE_SERVER_PORT
Open the Command Palette â†’ > Forward a Port
```

Enter the port shown above (e.g. 33419)

Start gemini-cli:

gemini
Inside the CLI, check if IDE integration is enabled:

/ide enabled
Then verify connection:

/ide status
ðŸ’¡ Without forwarding this dynamic port manually, gemini-cli will hang or fail to connect to the IDE extension.
